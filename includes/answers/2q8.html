Routers are typically added in the dispatching of the `controller_front_init_routers` event in `Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Front::init`.<br/>
Within the method that is observing that event, use the `addRouter` method on the passed front controller (see `Mage_Cms_Controller_Router::initControllerRouters` as an example).
