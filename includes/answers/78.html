<p>All your own product types that provide configuration controls for a shopper fall under the Composite Products functionality.
  Remember to complete the following steps to provide your users with a solid Magento-style experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement the _prepareProduct() method in a type model to parse each incoming POST-request in to product options;
    options must implement the Configuration Item Option interface.</li>
  <li>Implement the processBuyRequest() method in a type model to transform a buyRequest into option values for the Edit configuration mode.</li>
  <li>Create frontend configuration controls for the View Product page that can display preconfigured values in Edit configuration mode.</li>
  <li>If you have file upload controls:
    <ol>
      <li>their validation models should add the files to the file copy queue after successful validation.</li>
      <li>their rendering blocks should be able to work in the Edit configuration mode:<br >
        show the user the current configuration and allow uploaded files to be changed/deleted.</li>
      <li>you need to implement the ability to download the files in the Wishlist and the Shopping Cart controllers,
      the same way Custom Options files can be downloaded, when viewing an item's configuration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Create the Configuration Helper for your product type. It should return an array of option values specific to this product type,
  and merge them with the option values (custom options) that are inherited from basic product type.</li>
  <li>Register the Configuration Helper in the layouts to show the product options in the frontend Shopping Cart,
    Wishlist pages and the Customer Management pages in the Admin Panel (Wishlist, Shopping Cart and Manage Shopping Cart in Magento EE).</li>
  <li>Add your product type to the "available product types" so it will be used in the Create Order page in the Admin Panel.</li>
  <li>Create the backend configuration controls (inherited from frontend controls, but having the template and the Javascript suitable for the backend specifics).</li>
  <oi>Adjust the _canConfigure property and/or the canConfigure() method in the product type model
    so the Configure buttons and links will appear in the Admin Panel when needed.
  </oi>
</ul>
