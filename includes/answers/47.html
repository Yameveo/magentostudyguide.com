<p>A “<strong>model</strong>” is used to store data, and perhaps performs some business logics against that data.</p>
<p>A <strong>“resource model</strong>” is used to interact with the database on behalf of the “model”. The “resource model” actually performs the CRUD operations.</p>
<p>A <strong>“collection mode</strong>l” holds from one to many “models” and knows how to tell the “resource model” to get rows in the basis of information it is given.</p>
<p>There’s a basic ActiveRecord-like/one-object-one-table Model, and there’s also an Entity Attribute Value (EAV) Model.</p>
