<i>The Zend_Db_Select object represents a SQL SELECT query statement.
  The class has methods for adding individual parts to the query.
  You can specify some parts of the query using PHP methods and data structures,
  and the class forms the correct SQL syntax for you.
  After you build a query, you can execute the query as if you had written it as a string.</i><br/><br/>
