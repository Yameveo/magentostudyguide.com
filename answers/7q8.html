<pre>
The product price is only read from the index tables when you are using product collections, i.e. when you are handling several products at a time. When you get a single product, for example on the product view page, the price is generated on the fly.

And now the explanation with some code references:

When you consider the Mage_Catalog_Model_Product, you will see that the method getFinalPrice() calls $this->getPriceModel()->getFinalPrice($qty, $this); In turn, the default price model (Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price) calculates the price in the method getFinalPrice() and also fires the event catalog_product_get_final_price which is used by some module (I think it was the catalog or the cart price rules) to adjust the price. This method is a calculation "on-the-fly" so without indexes.

In the collection (Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource_Product_Collection) the price indexer is used to reduce the complicated procedure of calcaluting the price for each product. It defines a map to assign the fields to the appropriate indexed fields:

protected $_map = array('fields' => array(
'price'         => 'price_index.price',
'final_price'   => 'price_index.final_price',
'min_price'     => 'price_index.min_price',
'max_price'     => 'price_index.max_price',
'tier_price'    => 'price_index.tier_price',
'special_price' => 'price_index.special_price',
));
The indexer which does the work is the class Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Indexer_Price.
