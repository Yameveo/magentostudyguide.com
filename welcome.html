<p>If you are looking for some materials to prepare for the Magento Certified Developer exam then you're in the right place!<br />
We've started gathering some study resources. You can find them by clicking the links on the left. You can click on the files references too
 and the content of the files will simply be displayed here.</p>
<h2>What is this Magento Study Guide?</h2>
<p>This website was created when I wanted to have quick reference to all my study materials in one place.
 I've gathered all notes all the files which are mentioned in the official preparation document published
 by Magento <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/" target="_blank">here</a>. Then I thought that this information can
 I obviously help other people to prepare for the exam too. In that case, a possibility of contribution would be an advantage.
 So, here you go!</p>
<h2>What this Magento Study Guide is not?</h2>
<p>The materials gathered on this website are not answers to the actual questions which will be on the certification exam.
 I don't know what the questions will be. However Magento gave some indication regarding the materials which will be covered.
 That's how we can have this.</p>
<p>This website is also not a marketing venture. It's made by community and for community. However if I'm grabbing materials
 from other people's website I ask them for permission to place it here in exchange for a link back and putting their logo on the "Contributors" page.
</p>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
<p>This website have been created as a Magento community project and it's free to browse and contribute by anyone.
 It would be great if you could support us be spreading the word
 and by forking <a href="https://github.com/marcinsdance/magentostudyguide.com" target="_blank">this project on Github</a>
 or submitting suggestions by sending the form available for each of the subjects, questions and files
 (you can see the 'contribut' button when hovering items in the sidebar).</p>
